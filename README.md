### Instructions:
Implement the uniform_cost_search function. The input to this function is the start state, one
or more goal states, the input graph and the cost of edges in the graph. Your implementation of
the uniform_cost_search should return the minimum cost(s) of reaching the goal state(s) from
the start state. In addition to the minimum cost(s), return and print
the path with the minimum cost(s) from start to goal state(s).
